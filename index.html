	        <q>Everything's better with some wine in the belly.</q>
	        <q>I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me.</q>
	        <q>It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on it's head.</q>
	        <q>When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.</q>
	        <q>I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.</q>
	        <q>Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?</q>
	        <q>I just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world.</q>
	        <q>My brother has his sword, and I have my mind. A mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.</q>
	        <q>A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you will know the debt is paid.</q>
	        <q>It's not easy being drunk all the time. If it were easy, everyone would do it.</q>
	        <q>I wish I was the monster you think I am.</q>
	        <q>Though I would treasure your friendship, I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder. And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this: whatever their price, I'll beat it. I like living.</q>
	        <q>Trial by combat, deciding a man’s guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. It tells you something about the gods.</q>
	        <q>If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.</q>
	        <q>Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.</q>
	        <q>I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence.</q>

	        <q>Not today.</q>
	        <q>Someday, I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.</q>
	        <q>A bruise is a lesson... and each lesson makes us better.</q>
	        <q>Fear cuts deeper than swords.</q>
	        <q>All of you better run or my brother will kill you. He's a Stark, he's more wolf than man, and so am I.</q>
	        <q>I don't want to be a lady.</q>

	        <q>If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep.</q>
	        <q>The gods have no mercy, that's why they're gods.</q>
	        <q>When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.</q>
	        <q>The more people you love the weaker you are.</q>
	        <q>Seize him. Cut his throat. Stop, wait. I’ve changed my mind. Let him go. Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. <br/>Power is power.</q>
	        <q>Everyone who isn’t us is an enemy.</q>
	        <q>Tears aren’t a woman’s only weapon. The best one’s between your legs.</q>

	        <q>All men must die, but we are not men.</q>
	        <q>Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier.</q>
	        <q>It takes courage to admit fear.</q>
	        <q>I will answer injustice with justice.</q>
	        <q>I'm not going to stop the wheel, I'm going to break the wheel.</q>
	        <q>I will take what is mine with fire and blood.</q>
	        <q>Woman? Is that meant to insult me? I would return the slap if I took you for a man.</q>

	        <q>Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.</q>

	        <q>Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb, they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.</q>
	        <q>Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever.</q>
	        <q>It doesn’t matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else.</q>
